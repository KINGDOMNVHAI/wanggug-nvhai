Nói về buổi 3D https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GQKQ5vAskA

Oh, speaking of 3D
Ồ, nói về 3D

Time family saw parts of it


especially time mom saw... like parts of my stream.


and Sally also saw it.


And they were asking me:
"Is that actual full body tracking?"

"Because... I don't know.
The... the way you moved".
"Vì... tui không biết nữa. Cách bà di chuyển..."

"It... it really did"

"It... it really did seem like your movement".

I thought that was funny
Tui nghĩ cái đó vui đấy chứ.

Were they impressed?
Họ ngạc nhiên lắm à?

I... I don't know.
Tui không biết nữa.

"Chúng ta rất tự hào về con".

No, they're not!
Không, không có đâu!

No, they don't... they don't really... react to it.

They just like: "Oh... yeah, she... she doing things"
